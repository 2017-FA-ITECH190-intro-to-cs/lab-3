# Introduction to Computer Science - Fall 2017

## Lab 3 - A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words

**Purpose:** The purpose of this lab is to start playing with basic _JavaScript_ and see some of the ways in which it can interact with _HTML_.

**Practice:** Study the [JavaScript demos](itech190.erickuha.com). Make sure you understand how they work. Ask questions if you are uncertain about anything at all.

**Instructions:** Create a web page called _images.html_ that contains the sun image and the heart image. The images should be centered on the page, the sun should be to the left of the heart. They are both located in the assignment repository root.

Next, set things up (write some JavaScript) so that the following happens:

* When the mosue moves over the image on the left (initially the sun), the image on the right (initially the heart) changes to the sun.
* When the mouse is not over the image on the left, the right image reverts to being the heart.
* When the mouse is moved over the image on the right (the heart), the two images swap places. That is, the heart should become the left image and the sun should become the right image. _Note:_ that there is no further action associated with this. They should switch and it should be permanent.

Commit and push your repo when you are finished.
